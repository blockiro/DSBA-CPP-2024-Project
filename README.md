## Topic:
> - Implementing K-Means Clustering Algorithm within console application for Wine Clustering Dataset Analysis. 


## Description of the Project:
> - This project aims to develop a console application for analysing a dataset containing information about various types of wine. Implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm, the tool will sort wine into different categories based on their features such as alcohol content, acidity, color intensity, etc. After processing, the application will display the categorised wines making it easy for users to explore the data.

## Requirements:
> - **Programming Language:**
> The console application will be developed using C++

> - **Interface Approach:**
> Develop a console interface that allows users to input parameters such as number of clusters, maximum iterations and selecting dataset.

> - **External Data Handling:**
> Ability to read .csv files for input data and write .txt files for output.


## Interface:
> 1. Console Interface that enables users to interact via the console, providing input parameters such as number of clusters, dataset and optional settings.
> 2. The application supports reading from .csv files and writing to .txt files.


## Tasks in GitHub Project:
> 1. **Project Initialization:**
> - Set up project in repository on GitHub with a readme file and the initial project structure.

> 2. **Cluster and Point Classes:**
 > - Create classes for representing clusters and data points.
 > - Develop functions for classes.

> 3. **Console Interface:**
 > - Develop the console interface.

> 4. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
 > - Conduct integration testing to ensure the console interface works as expected.
 > - Refine the user interface based on feedback.
